Description: Distinct mutational processes shape the genomes of clones comprising a tumor. These processes 
    result in distinct mutational patterns, summarized by a small number of mutational signatures. Our R package, 
    PhySigs, solves the Tree-constrained Exposure problem, which outputs clone-specific exposures to mutational 
    signatures while accounting for evolutionary context. Our package also includes model selection to identify 
    the number of exposure shifts along branches of the tumor phylogeny that best explain the data.
